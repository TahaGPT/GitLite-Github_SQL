# 🖥️ GitLite (GitHub Clone) – C++ DSA Implementation

![C++ Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/ISO_C%2B%2B_Logo.svg)

## 📖 Overview
This project is a **C++ application** that demonstrates the application of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** by building a **GitHub-like platform** from scratch.  
It replicates essential GitHub functionalities including:
- Creating repositories and projects
- Managing branching and merging
- Deleting branches
- Implementing **version control**

The backend logic is powered by **efficient data structures** such as **AVL Trees**, **Red-Black Trees**, and **B-Trees**, optimized for storing and managing repository data.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Apply **DSA concepts** in a real-world inspired project.
- Build a **GitHub-like system** with core functionalities.
- Explore and implement **tree-based data structures** for repository management.
- Optimize performance for branching, merging, and versioning operations.

---

## 🛠 Features
- ✅ **Create Projects/Repositories**
- ✅ **Branching** – create, view, and manage branches
- ✅ **Merging branches** with version control logic
- ✅ **Deleting branches** safely
- ✅ **Version history** tracking for repositories
- ✅ **Backend storage using**:
  - AVL Trees
  - Red-Black Trees
  - B-Trees
- ✅ **Optimized performance** for large repository data
